This is a C++ implementation of generic self-organizing binary search trees.

A self organizing binary search tree can restructure itself depending on the search frequency of the elements in the tree.

* bst.hpp contains the sobst implementation
* sobst_driver.cpp shows some examples of how to use the implementation

To compile the program, simply open a terminal, navigate to the containing directory, and type `make`

To run the program, execute the `sobst` program built by the makefile.  It will ask you for some input and display some tests.  It will then display a menu allowing you to manipulate the bst you created.
